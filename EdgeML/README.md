## EdgeML: Enhancing On-Device ML with Quantised Models and Out-of-Distribution detection

## Objectives: Optimized OOD-Detection
The primary objective of this solution is to optimize OOD detection for improving AI safety in autonomous vehicles and medical systems:

Robust OOD Detection: Develop and implement robust methodologies to detect OOD data points, enabling ML models to identify scenarios beyond their training distribution with high reliability.

Efficient System: The model is small enough to be deployed on small devices and doesnâ€™t add lot of compute for the out of detection task. Hence, we applied performed neural network compression technique of quantization.
